 c is procedure oriented language
 procedure is function/sub program
 advantages of functions;
   1.reusability
   2.debugging is easy
   3.c is general purpose and its compiler based,high level procedure oriented programming language
sql,unix,linux is developed by c
compiler converts high level language to low level language
invented by dennis ritche in 1972
 
sample.c
execution flow of c:
 preprocesser: macro substitution,file inclusion,conditional compilation.
 statements after # are called prprocessive stmnts
file inclusion:
 #include<stdio.h>---->predefined header file
 #include"gitam.h"---->userdefined header file
macro substitution:
 2+3*2+3=11 not expanded only substituted
pure sample.c
compiler:
    converts to sampl.asl
assembler:
    converts into obj code/machine code
    sample.obj
     sample.obj*
linker/loader:machine code to os
 sample.exe
turbo c:
 sample.bak
   according to turbo c compiler:
 int a
%d integer -32,768 to +36,767 2bytes
charc
%c character -128 to +127 1byte
float 
% float 3.4e-3.4 to 3.4 e+3.4 4 bytes
double c=12345.123456789
% if double 1.7e-308 to 1.7 e+308 8 bytes
char str[100]
%s string//depend on no of charaters
long int a=123456789
%id long int -2147483647to +2147483648 4 bytes
undigned int 
%u 0 to 65535 2bytes
syn:
   scanf("format specifier",&var_list);
   int scanf(char *)

types of operators:
 1)arthemetic operators:+,-,/,*and %
 %--- remainder
 /---- integer quotient
 145%10=5
 ie to extraqct first digit of any number use %10
 remove first digit of any num use /10
 2)logical operator:&&(and),||(or),!(not)
 3)relational operator:<,<=,>,>=,==,!=
 4)sizeof() operator:
     find the size of any operator linear/data type
 5)ternary or conditional operator:
 exp1?exp2:exp3;
 6)assingment operator:
 =
+=,-=,*=,%=,/= compund assignment
a+=b-->a=a+b
 7)increament/decreament operator:
 ++,-- pre and post
 8)bit wise operator:
 and &
 or
 negation ~
 xor ^
 left shift <<
 right shift >>
 9) special operators such as comma(,)
